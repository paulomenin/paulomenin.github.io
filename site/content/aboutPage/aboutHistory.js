        My history with computers began a long time ago when I was a child at 9
        years old. I remember watching movies with people using computers and
        started playing with boxes imagining that I&apos;m using computers. I
        asked my parents to learn how to use it. My parents tried to enroll me
        in a computer school, but they didn&apos;t accept me because I was too
        young.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some years later, another school accepted me as a student for a basic
        course: MS-DOS, Windows 95, and Microsoft Office. I was the youngest
        student in the class. My interest in computers only grew. When I
        finished the basic course I was enrolled in a advanced course:
        Introduction to programming with Visual Basic and Borland Delphi.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember these days when I was eager for the Elementary School classes
        to end just to be home and start programming in the evenings.

        One day when I was in High School I saw a magazine about Linux. I bought
        it! It came with a minimal version of the Slackware Linux (ZipSlack). It
        took me a lot of days to install it and configure X with Window Maker.
        That episode was a turning point in my life. That was the first
        challenge that I remember that I did on my own without help from anyone
        else, I didn&apos;t known anybody who has been using Linux. Learning
        Linux exploring man pages and reading internet articles in English (at
        that time understanding English was challenging for me) opened my mind
        to have confidence that I can learn anything that I want!
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2002 I enrolled in a Computer Technician course, where I have contact
        with Clipper programming language, C, and more deep on Visual Basic and
        Delphi. During that time I build and sell my first software, a
        management program for a school, with features to keep track of
        students&apos; grades, teachers schedules and print some reports. At
        that time I wanted to learn more and enroll in a Bachelor of Computer
        Science course.

        2005 was the year I ingressed at{" "}
        <Link href="https://www.icmc.usp.br/en/">ICMC-USP</Link> BCS course,
        which is among the best ranked in Brazil. During the undergraduate
        course, I always seek to participate in extracurricular activities. I
        was a volunteer in a project that teaches how to use computers to people
        that can&apos;t afford to pay for a course. I joined &quot;Sanca
        Livre&quot; the OpenSource group from São Carlos, where I helped to
        organize events like the FLISOL 2006 (Festival Latinoamericano de
        Instalación de Software Libre). I helped the organization of two
        editions of &quot;SemComp&quot;, ICMC&apos;s computing week event full
        of talks and workshops.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2014 I passed the exam for the Scrum Master certification. In 2023 I
        graduated in Software Architecture and Solutions from XP Education.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my professional career, I had always been working on projects for big
        multinational companies. Always using Agile Methodologies. I worked on a
        wide range of projects and technologies: Web development, command-line
        tools, desktop applications, embedded systems, computer vision, machine
        learning, 3D printing, IoT, drones, and distributed systems. This
        diversity of experiences among contact with many different programming
        languages, from C for embedded systems to high-level languages like
        Python, enabled me to always be learning something new and have contact
        with different ways of thinking, patterns, and solutions to problems
        from different viewpoints. This also made me develop the skill to learn
        something new very fast. Many times I was exposed to different
        technologies and need to learn it fast at the point to become a focal
        point for the team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day at night I ask this question to myself: What did I learn
        today?
