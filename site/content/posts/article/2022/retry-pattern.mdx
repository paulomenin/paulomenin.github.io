In a distributed environment we have services calling external resources,
these resources can be temporarily unavailable for many reasons.
A resilient application must know how to deal with the failures of other services.

One way to handle failures of external calls is using a retry pattern.
A retry mechanism will control the interval between attempts and the number
of retries before giving up.

But first, an application must determine if the failure is transient.
A transient failure occurs because of a temporary fault condition that causes
a service down for a few seconds.
Examples of transient failures are:

- Network failure: missing connectivity for a short period.
- Unavailability: a service crash or down for maintenance.
- Overload: an external service that cannot accept new requests.

In another hand, an authentication failure, for example, will not be resolved
after a few seconds, and should not be retried.

Different applications have different requirements and require different fault
handling strategies. Some must retry more frequently, others can have a long interval
between attempts, for example, in background jobs where a user is not waiting for feedback.

Retry pattern should be used when faults may self-correct after a short delay.

#### Interval between attempts

Also known as Back-off time, the time to wait before another attempt. Some strategies are:

- Constant/Fixed interval: the interval is the same between attempts.
- Incremental Back-off: the interval is calculated based on the number of attempts,
  it can be calculated in many ways:
  - Linear: using a constant multiplier.
  - Exponential: <TeX math="t = b^c" /> where
    <TeX math="t" /> is the time delay,
    <TeX math="b" /> is the multiplicative factor and
    <TeX math="c" /> is the number of attempts. A common value for b is 2 ( <TeX math="t = 2^c" /> ),
    which will double the delay for every attempt.
  - Fibonacci: the sum of the last two intervals.
- Random: usually a value between a minimum and a maximum range.

Also, a strategy can use combinations, like a constant interval plus jitter (a short random delay)
to avoid many parallel attempts to fire at the same time.
Another combination is to use a truncated back-off time, it is to define a maximum time
so the attempts don't end up waiting longer and longer.

#### When to give up

A common strategy to give up the operation and abort is to use a fixed number of attempts.

Another possibility is to use a timeout, in this case, the number of attempts will depend on the strategy
used to determine the back-off time.
