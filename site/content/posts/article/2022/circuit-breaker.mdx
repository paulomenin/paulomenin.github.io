In a distributed environment we have services calling resources that can be
temporarily failing for many reasons, like down to maintenance or system dificulties.
A resilient and fault-tolerant application handles failures gracefully to avoid
propagating them throughout the system.

The Circuit Breaker pattern can improve the stability and resilience of an application
by acting as a safeguard detecting when a service is likely to fail and preventing
calling this service. It works like a "switch" that open or closes the circuit based on
the availability of the service. After a number of failed requests to a service it will
block requests for a period of time
